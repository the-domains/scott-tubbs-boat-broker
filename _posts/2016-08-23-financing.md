# Financing

Whether you're buying new or pre-owned, we have financing options for you. Our lending partners focus on marine lending - which is not the norm for big-box chains and credit unions. 

A boat loan is structured very much like a home mortgage. It's a simple-interest loan with no penalties if you repay early. And in some cases, you can deduct the interest you pay on the loan as an expense on your federal taxes (consult your resident tax professional). 

Rates are based on a number of factors associated with your purchase and can be as low as 3.99% with terms up to 20 years.
