# About Your Broker

I'm a Licensed Yacht Broker in the state of Florida and a member of the Florida Yacht Broker's Association.

I'm also a lifelong boater and overall water-sports enthusiasts with first-hand experience in boat building, (boat) factory operations and management, dealerships and boat sales. 

With previous careers at Fortune 500 companies in management, sales and training, and a United States Air Force Veteran, I'm a driven professional with a commitment to quality and service. 

_"I enjoy helping people & families find the right boat. It's a relationship. Everyone comes in as a friend, and leaves as family!"_
